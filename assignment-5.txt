1. Computational Thinking in Action: AI-Powered Study Planner with Task Reminder
1.1. Problem Definition: Personalized and Adaptive Study Planning

Traditional study planners often rely on static schedules and manual task prioritization, which fail to account for the dynamic nature of learning, such as fluctuating attention spans, varying task difficulties, and individual learning curves. The core problem is the lack of adaptivity and personalization in study scheduling. A student’s time allocation should be optimized based on their current knowledge gaps, the complexity of the material, and their performance history.

The goal of the AI-Powered Study Planner with Task Reminder is to solve this by:

Dynamic Prioritization: Automatically prioritizing tasks based on a combination of due dates, estimated effort, and the student’s historical performance in related subjects.

Adaptive Scheduling: Adjusting study session lengths and breaks using a simple AI/ML model (e.g., linear regression or weighted scoring) that learns the student’s optimal focus duration and time-of-day productivity.

Intelligent Reminders: Providing reminders that are context-aware, prompting the student to review material they are statistically more likely to forget (Spaced Repetition System).

1.2. Algorithm (Pseudocode): Adaptive Task Prioritization and Scheduling
FUNCTION Calculate_Priority_Score(Task, Student_Profile, Current_Date):
    // 1. Time-Based Urgency (Weight: 0.4)
    Days_Until_Due = Task.Due_Date - Current_Date
    Urgency_Score = MAX(0, 100 - (Days_Until_Due * 10))

    // 2. Effort/Difficulty (Weight: 0.3)
    Effort_Score = Task.Estimated_Effort * 10

    // 3. AI/ML Adaptive Factor (Weight: 0.3)
    Subject_Performance = Student_Profile.Performance[Task.Subject]  // 0.0 to 1.0
    Adaptive_Factor = (1 - Subject_Performance) * 100

    // 4. Final Weighted Priority Score
    Priority_Score = (Urgency_Score * 0.4) + (Effort_Score * 0.3) + (Adaptive_Factor * 0.3)

    RETURN Priority_Score

FUNCTION Generate_Adaptive_Schedule(Task_List, Student_Profile, Available_Time):
    FOR EACH Task IN Task_List:
        Task.Priority = Calculate_Priority_Score(Task, Student_Profile, Current_Date)
    
    Sorted_Tasks = SORT(Task_List, BY Task.Priority DESCENDING)
    
    Schedule = EMPTY_LIST
    Time_Remaining = Available_Time
    
    FOR EACH Task IN Sorted_Tasks:
        IF Time_Remaining > 0:
            Optimal_Session_Length = Student_Profile.Learned_Focus_Duration
            Session_Duration = MIN(Task.Remaining_Time, Optimal_Session_Length, Time_Remaining)
            Time_Remaining -= Session_Duration
            ADD ("Task", Session_Duration) TO Schedule
            IF Time_Remaining >= 10:
                ADD ("Break", 10) TO Schedule
                Time_Remaining -= 10
    
    RETURN Schedule

1.3. Flowchart Description

Start/Input: Input student profile, task list, and available time.

Process (Priority Calculation): Calculate priority score for every task.

Decision (Sort): Sort tasks in descending order of priority.

Loop (Task Iteration): Iterate through sorted tasks.

Decision (Time Check): Check if available time > 0.

Process (Determine Session): Determine optimal session length.

Decision (Session Duration Check): Verify session duration > 0.

Process (Add Session): Add task session to schedule.

Decision (Break Check): Check if a 10-min break is possible.

Process (Add Break): Add break to schedule.

End/Output: Output the adaptive schedule.

2. Exploring Emerging Technology Domain: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
2.1. Technology Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulates human intelligence processes like learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, enables systems to learn and improve from data without explicit programming.

Key Sub-fields:

Supervised Learning: Models trained on labeled data.

Unsupervised Learning: Models detect hidden patterns in unlabeled data.

Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn by maximizing rewards in an environment.

Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple layers for complex data analysis.
